<p>
  I sometimes envy people that have their "thing," because they must always know exactly what to do with their free
  time, but that's not me, I've always been a man of varied interests and pursuits. My hobbies include playing musical
  instruments, snowboarding, cycling, thrift shopping, basketball, painting and fishing. I'm interested in
  maps/geography and nature, travel and other cultures, stories in the form of quality movies/books, and
  technology/understanding how things work. I'm fluent in Spanish and I volunteer as a translator. The values most
  important to me are honesty, openness, kindness and creativity, I do my very best to practice them daily. I'm
  committed to personal growth and I do yoga, improv comedy and other stuff that helps me to be a better person. I
  believe that all the world's problems can be solved by people smiling and listening more. Oh, and I like eating good
  food, and eating okay food too.
