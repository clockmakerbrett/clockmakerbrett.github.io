This is my very first time going live to the world wide web with content, my "hello, world" moment and, quite fittingly, it is Earth Day.

I'm not really a blogger type, yet here I am, just a bloggin' fool. My main motiviation is to showcase my skills in web development but I may as well have some fun with it, and sprinkle a little Brett onto this endeavor.

At this point I have spent 6 months learning Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Express and Mongoose, all the things for creating full-stack web applications, so it figures I'm going live for the first time with Jekyll, a site generator written in Ruby that uses markdown for content, liquid for templating, and this strange yml stuff, none of which I've touched. C'est la vie. Fact is, I'm not yet good enough to build a complex web app, so I'll start here.

P.S.

Happy Earth Day! Here are some things I do:

- Reuse whenever possible (thrift shop junkie here)
- Bicycle to get around (ride or die, la da da da da da)
  - I also like riding the train, and I tolerate walking
- If it's yellow, I let it mellow (saves flushes/water)
  - I don't do this at the office, though :)
