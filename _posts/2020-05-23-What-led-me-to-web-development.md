title: What led me to web development

I graduated with a B.S. in Environmental Science in 2012, and worked in a very niche area of environmental for 5 years. I had some awesome experiences at that job, but the rigorous travel and crazy long hours led me to seek other opportunities, and I found that I wasn't qualified for much else. But, finally, I was able to land a job in telecom construction project management with a company that was willing to train me. At this job I learned valuable teamwork and project management skills. Just as important - I was able to thrive in my personal life and gain a level of mental and physical health that I was unable to achieve during my time living out of a duffel bag for half the year.

Because of my new-found clarity, I realized that, since I was only a year into a career restart of sorts, why not pick something better? I had already accepted the reality that without acquiring more concrete skills, I would be doomed to a mediocre career didn't fully utilize my potential for problem-solving and critical thinking, and that pays me as such. But I was very reluctant to go back to college and into debt. I did not know what to do.

After speaking with a web developer at my Spanish Conversation group, I thought the lifestyle sounded pretty great and realized that it could be the solution to my career woes. I've never been _super_ passionate about technology, but one insight that I've had about myself is that I care more about what I'm doing than why I'm doing it. For instance, working in environmental, something that I am passionate about, didn't do much for me when I wasn't enjoying the day-to-day. So, I dipped my toes into coding, and found that I do enjoy the "what" of it, and while the outcome isn't nearly as important to me, I have grown to admire the elegance with which code can manifest itself as a final product.

My experience thus far has been with Codecademy. I'm enrolled in a bootcamp that focuses on the MERN technology stacks, starting next month.
