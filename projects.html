<p>
  I built the following websites with only one year of coding experience, imagine what else I'm capable of. Some of them
  take several seconds to load since they're deployed with free services.

        React app that takes user input of an artist and queries theaudiodb.com to GET their hometown and other data,
        .then() queries mapbox's geocoding API for the coordinates of that location and zooms to it on the embedded
        mapbox instance. Uses best practices for state management.

        A QGIS project of mine from a few years ago that uses spatial analysis to divide the states up in a more logical
        way. Exported to and overlayed on an OpenLayers webmap instance. Uses jQuery for interactivity - assigning event
        listeners and DOM manipulation. Custom CSS.

        A silly game, coded entirely from scratch by yours truly, in vanilla JS. Animated with the html canvas API.
        Spatial logic, collision detection, and animation loop defined using methods and classes, applying principles of
        functional and object-oriented programming. Best practices used to keep it DRY and SOLID. Not mobile-friendly.
