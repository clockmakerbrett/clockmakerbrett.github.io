title: What is 'clockmaker' all about?

Around the time I began learning to code I was obsessed with Sturgill Simpson's new album _Sound and Fury_ and one of my favorite songs on it has the chorus "I'm gonna wake up everyday and be the best clockmaker on mars."

When I listen to that song I imagine a faceless man, alone on mars, machining tiny clock parts, and every century or so, completing the assembly of a beautiful, dead-accurate clock that no one else will ever set eyes on, let alone use to tell time.

To me, those lyrics and that image mean that when I set about a task I'm going to apply myself to it one-hundred percent, for me. Regardless of whether anyone else notices my quality work or even cares about the final product of it.

Truly living this philosophy was something that I needed to work on. So, a lot of my string inputs while learning to code became "I'm gonna wake up everyday and be the best clockmaker on mars." Then my username, as I started signing up for web services, became 'clockmakerbrett', and now it's a thing.

But that's what it's about... Also I imagine the process of making a clock is somewhat analogous to that of building a web application.
