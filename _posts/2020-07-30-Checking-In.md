I'm into yoga and meditation. Not so much because I want to be but because I need to be. Maybe there are some people that are just instinctively guided towards their best future. Not me. Every so often I need to calm my mind and check in.

I'm nearly halway through my bootcamp. Here's a list of what I've learned so far. Yes they are buzzwords, but they are things I have _actually_ learned. Don't take my word for it though, take a look at my <a href="/projects">projects</a> page to see this stuff in action.

- MongoDB and SQL
- JavaScript and jQuery
- SCSS and Bootstrap
- HTML and Handlebars

Skills
