  <p>Just a few of the many reasons...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ability to focus on the details <b>and</b> see the big picture comes naturally to me.</li>
    <li>I really enjoy solving problems on my own, but I'm not to proud to ask for help.</li>
    <li>I put conscious effort into making people that I interact with feel good.</li>
    <li>I'm excited to learn and I want this more than other candidates, <i>guaranteed</i>.</li>

    Born Brett Matthew Sherwood in Seattle metro on the
    <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/KSEA/date/1989-12-12" target="_blank">unusually dry</a> winter
    evening of December 12, 1989. Both myself and the grunge music scene were in their infancy and would experience a
    whirlwind of events in the early 90s. From learning to walk and talk to becoming the first alternative music
    recognized by MTV, it was a crazy time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, at the humble age of five I headed south for the greener pastures of Portland metro area, where I took great
    pleasure in the simple things - drawing, playing basketball, and behaving strangely. In my adolescence I cultivated
    an above average level of angst and recklessness, and developed a love for activities that got the adrenaline
    pumping, snowboarding and doing stupid things.
